# AugJS
### A Simple Component-based Javascript Framework

---

AugJS is a Javascript Framework based around concepts found in frameworks such as React, VueJS and processors such as Pug and HAML, toned down by quite a lot.

The name comes from "Augment" and reflects the nature of augment-able components that the framework aims to achieve.

This is my foray into learning more about how to program using vanilla Javascript!

# AugJS

### A Simple Component-based Javascript Framework

</center>

---

AugJS is a simple, streamlined UI Templating framework that acts as a light-weight wrapper around the upcoming Web Component and Shadow DOM standards.

It's features include:

- Scoped CSS
- Straightforward Templating
- Modularized, Pluggable Code

View it in action [here](https://tehjawn.github.io/AugJS/src/)

Latest changes:

- Moved SRC4 and SRC5 to /old

- SRC6 (/src) rewritten from scratch based on legacy Shadow DOM (createShadowRoot and content instead of attachShadow and slot) with additional features such as one-way data-binding through a primitive version of handlebars
